# math-tutor

this is the coreLogic branch


## Basic Components

- Core logic independent of GUI
- Basic Question Handling, Checking Answer and Lesson completion alert
- 2 lessons (additon easy and medium)
- Timer function
- Score function (+5 for correct, -2 for wrong)

## Implementation
Below, is a simple implementation of the independent core logic of the math tutor. Here, GTK and QT are running separately. In the screenshot below, qt6plug.py and gtk6plug.py are running simultaneously. Both GTK and QT are using the module coreLogic and the 3 classes from it:-
- QuestionManager 
- ScoreManager 
- Timer
